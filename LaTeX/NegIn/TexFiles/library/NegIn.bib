	abstract = {Negation is known to have inhibitory consequences for the information under its scope. However, how it produces such effects remains poorly understood. Recently, it has been proposed that negation processing might be implemented at the neural level by the recruitment of inhibitory and cognitive control mechanisms. On this line, this manuscript offers the hypothesis that negation reuses general-domain mechanisms that subserve inhibition in other non-linguistic cognitive functions. The first two sections describe the inhibitory effects of negation on conceptual representations and its embodied effects, as well as the theoretical foundations for the reuse hypothesis. The next section describes the neurophysiological evidence that linguistic negation interacts with response inhibition, along with the suggestion that both functions share inhibitory mechanisms. Finally, the manuscript concludes that the functional relation between negation and inhibition observed at the mechanistic level could be easily integrated with predominant cognitive models of negation processing.},

	abstract = {There has been a substantial amount of research that has examined how context affects people's understanding of negation. Many authors argue that negation is more plausible or natural in some contexts than in others. For these authors, it is reasonable to negate a proposition only when it is presupposed. However, this assumption has been indirectly inferred from comprehension studies. None of them checked if the frequency of the spontaneous use of negation depends on the context. In this paper we present two experiments on this topic. The participants read stories where a sentence is false; and were asked to produce a sentence that could be true. In the first experiment they produced more negations from multiple than from bipolar contexts (e.g., when the false sentence was “ the car was red ” as compared to “ the car was big ”). In the second experiment the context was logically dichotomized by adding disjunctions. In this case, incongruent contexts enhanced the use of negation. The results seem to support the idea that when there is a clear alternative, negation is seldom spontaneously produced even if it denies a presupposition.},

	abstract = {Embodiment theories claim that language meaning involves sensory–motor simulation processes in the brain. A challenge for these theories, however, is to explain how abstract words, such as negations, are processed. In this article, we test the hypothesis that understanding sentential negation (e.g., You will not cut the bread) reuses the neural circuitry of response inhibition. Participants read manual action sentences with either affirmative or negative polarity, embedded in a Stop–Signal paradigm, while their {EEG} was recorded. The results showed that the inhibition-related N1 and P3 components were enhanced by successful inhibition. Most important, the early N1 amplitude was also modulated by sentence polarity, producing the largest values for successful inhibitions in the context of negative sentences, whereas no polarity effect was found for failing inhibition or go trials. The estimated neural sources for N1 effects revealed activations in the right inferior frontal gyrus, a typical inhibition-related area. Also, the estimated stop-signal reaction time was larger in trials with negative sentences. These results provide strong evidence that action-related negative sentences consume neural resources of response inhibition, resulting in less efficient processing in the Stop–Signal task.},

On the other hand, behavioral and neurophysiological studies provided evidence that linguistic negation suppresses or reduces the activation of the negated events, contributing to shift attention to the actual state of events. However, the specific mechanism of this suppression is poorly known. Recently, based on the brain organization principle of neural reuse ({\textless}xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"{\textgreater}Anderson, 2010{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}), it has been proposed that understanding linguistic negation partially relies upon the neurophysiological mechanisms of response inhibition.

In the current {EEG} study, we ponder whether the reusing of response inhibition processes by negation is constrained to action-related contents or consists of a more general-purpose mechanism. To this end, we employed the same dual-task paradigm as in our prior study—a Go/{NoGo} task embedded into a sentence comprehension task—but this time including both action and non-action sentences. The results confirmed that the increase of theta power elicited by {NoGo} trials was modulated by negative sentences, compared to their affirmative counterparts, and this polarity effect was statistically similar for both action- and non-action-related sentences. Thus, a general-purpose inhibitory control mechanism, rather than one specific for action language, is likely operating in the comprehension of sentential negation to produce the transition between alternative representations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In Experiment 2, the negation was pre-pended to the actual sentence using an introductory statement (It is (not) true that ladybirds are stripy) to provide additional processing time to deal with the negation operator. Crucially, in both experiments the N400 amplitude was larger for semantic and world-knowledge violations than correct sentences irrespective of the negation operator. Taken together, our study suggests that allowing additional time to process the negation operator alone – before encountering the information that completes the negated proposition – has no beneficial influence on on-line negation integration as reflected in the N400.},

In order to survive, the human brain has to integrate information from various sources and to derive a coherent interpretation, ideally leading to adequate behavior. In experimental setups, such integration phenomena are often investigated in terms of cross-modal association effects. Interestingly, to date, most of these cross-modal association effects using linguistic stimuli have shown that single words can influence the processing of non-linguistic stimuli, and vice versa. In the present study, we were particularly interested in how far linguistic input beyond single words influences the processing of non-linguistic stimuli; in our case, environmental sounds. Participants read sentences either in an affirmative or negated version: for example: “The dog does (not) bark”. Subsequently, participants listened to a sound either matching or mismatching the affirmative version of the sentence (‘woof’ vs. ‘meow’, respectively). In line with previous studies, we found a clear N400-like effect during sound perception following affirmative sentences. Interestingly, this effect was identically present following negated sentences, and the negation operator did not modulate the cross-modal association effect observed between the content words of the sentence and the sound. In summary, these results suggest that negation is not incorporated during information processing in a manner that word–sound association effects would be influenced.},

Negation has long been a field of inquiry in psychological theories and experiments of reasoning, which inspired many follow-up studies of negation and negation-related phenomena in psycholinguistics. In generative theoretical linguistics, negation and polarity sensitivity have been extensively studied, as the related phenomena are situated at the interfaces of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, and are thus extremely revealing about the architecture of grammar. With the now long tradition of research on negation and polarity in psychology and psycholinguistics, and the emerging field of experimental semantics and pragmatics, a multitude of interests and experimental paradigms have emerged which call for re-evaluations and further development and integration. This special issue contains a collection of 16 research articles on the processing of negation and negation-related phenomena including polarity items, questions, conditionals, and irony, using a combination of behavioral (e.g., rating, reading, eye-tracking and sentence completion) and neuroimaging techniques (e.g., {EEG}). They showcase the processing of negation and polarity with or without context, in various languages and across different populations (adults, typically developing and {ADHD} children). The integration of multiple theoretical and empirical perspectives in this collection provides new insights, methodological advances and directions for future research.},

While the grounding of meaning units such as content words and sentence has been widely investigated, little is known about logical cognitive operations and their association with nonlinguistic cognition. However, recent theoretical claims have suggested that 'the foundations of logical oppositions and negation may well be much more deeply rooted in the physiological structure of human cognition than is standardly assumed' (p. 227, Jaspers, 2012). The present study investigated potential candidates for such a grounding process by exploring the associations between basic 'yes' versus 'no' decisions and nonlinguistic features. In five preregistered experiments investigating the interplay between deciding 'yes' or 'no' and color, shape, and facial expressions, there was converging evidence for the intercoupling between the process of performing a 'yes' (agreeing) or 'no' (rejecting) decision and emotional faces (happy/sad), color (green/red), and also shape (round/square and soft/sharp). Potential mechanisms for such associations are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

However, recent theories propose that high-level human cognition is directly linked to basic, modal biological systems such as sensorimotor areas. Despite this influential representational debate very little is known regarding whether the mechanisms involved in sensorimotor control are also shared with higher-level cognitive processes, such as language comprehension. We investigated negation as a universal of human language, addressing two key questions: (a) Does negation result in a conflict-like representation? (b) Does negation trigger executive control adjustments in a similar manner as standard information processing conflicts do (e.g., Simon, Flanker)? Electrophysiological data indicated that phrases such as 'not left/not right' result in initial activation of the to-be-negated information and subsequently the outcome of the negation process. More importantly, our findings also suggest that negation triggers conflict-related adjustments in information processing in line with traditional conflict tasks. Trial-by-trial conflict adaptation patterns in both behavioral and electrophysiological data indicated that negation processing dynamically changes depending on the current cognitive state. In summary, negation processing results in cognitive conflict, and dynamic influences of the cognitive state determine conflict resolution, that is, negation implementation.

	abstract = {Background Studies demonstrating the involvement of motor brain structures in language processing typically focus on time windows beyond the latencies of lexical-semantic access. Consequently, such studies remain inconclusive regarding whether motor brain structures are recruited directly in language processing or through post-linguistic conceptual imagery. In the present study, we introduce a grip-force sensor that allows online measurements of language-induced motor activity during sentence listening. We use this tool to investigate whether language-induced motor activity remains constant or is modulated in negative, as opposed to affirmative, linguistic contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants listened to spoken action target words in either affirmative or negative sentences while holding a sensor in a precision grip. The participants were asked to count the sentences containing the name of a country to ensure attention. The grip force signal was recorded continuously. The action words elicited an automatic and significant enhancement of the grip force starting at approximately 300 ms after target word onset in affirmative sentences; however, no comparable grip force modulation was observed when these action words occurred in negative contexts. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that this simple experimental paradigm can be used to study the online crosstalk between language and the motor systems in an ecological and economical manner. Our data further confirm that the motor brain structures that can be called upon during action word processing are not mandatorily involved; the crosstalk is asymmetrically governed by the linguistic context and not vice versa.},

We assessed the impact of verb type and polarity on two typing dimensions: motor programming (lapse between target onset and first keystroke) and motor execution (lapse between first and last keystroke). Negation yielded no effect on motor planning, but it selectively delayed typing execution for manual-action verbs, irrespective of the subjects’ typing skills. This suggests that processing negations during comprehension of manual-action sentences recruits inhibitory mechanisms acting on same-effector movements.

This effect shows that peripheral motor aspects of primary task responses can still be influenced by inhibition even when the stop signal arrives too late to prevent the response. It thus requires modification of race models in which responses in the presence of stop signals are either stopped completely or produced normally, depending on whether the responding or stopping process finishes first.},

It remains unclear, however, whether such learning speeds responses to the next stimulus only by reducing the threshold for triggering the expected response after stimulus onset or also by preparing the expected response before stimulus onset. To distinguish between these competing accounts, we manipulated the probabilities with which each of two prime arrows (Left and Right) were followed by each of two probe arrows (Up and Down) in a prime-probe task while using force-sensitive keyboards to monitor sub-threshold finger force. Consistent with the response preparation account, two experiments revealed greater force just before probe onset on the response key corresponding to the direction in which the probe was more (versus less) likely to point (e.g., Up vs. Down). Furthermore, mirroring sequential contingency effects in behavior, this pre-probe force effect vanished after a single low-probability trial. These findings favor the response preparation account over the threshold only account. They also suggest the possibility that contingency learning in our tasks indexes trial-by-trial expectations regarding the utility of the prime for predicting the upcoming probe.},

Although the Stop/No-go P300 has been implicated as an index of inhibitory-control, it is unclear how the range of motor outputs relates to the P300. We examined the nature of this association in two experiments using an Anticipatory Timing and a Go/No-go Task, while measuring peak force, movement onset time, and P300. In both experiments, our results showed that trial-by-trial P300 amplitude on Failed Inhibitions were continuously related to peak force, where higher force (reflecting a greater degree of error) was associated with smaller P300 amplitude. Compared to Successful Inhibitions, P300 amplitude and onset latency on Failed Inhibitions were significantly reduced and delayed. Although the binary categorization of inhibition-success (Successful vs. Failed) accounts for significant variance in the P300, it misses a reliable linear relationship that can be captured by continuous measures of motor output. Overall, the results provide evidence that P300 may reflect the continuously varying engagement of inhibitory-control. We present an activation model to visualize the P300-force association and to illustrate how motor output might be modeled in the context of inhibitory-control. Our results highlight the relevance of P300 amplitude and the importance of studying the spectrum of motor output and the need for future models to account for motor output.},

In this study, force measurement was used to capture “partial” unsuccessful trials that are highly relevant in extending the current understanding of motor inhibition processing. Moreover, a modified version of the stop-signal task was used to control and eliminate potential attentional capture effects from the motor inhibition index. The results illustrate that the non-canceled force and force rate increased as a function of stop-signal delay ({SSD}), offering new objective indices for gauging the dynamic inhibitory process. Motor response (time and force) was a function of delay in the presentation of novel/infrequent stimuli. A larger lateralized readiness potential ({LRP}) amplitude in go and novel stimuli indicated an influence of the novel stimuli on central motor processing. Moreover, an early N1 component reflects an index of motor inhibition in addition to the N2 component reported in previous studies. Source analysis revealed that the activation of N2 originated from inhibitory control associated areas: the right inferior frontal gyrus ({rIFG}), pre-motor cortex, and primary motor cortex. Regarding partial responses, {LRP} and error-related negativity ({ERNs}) were associated with error correction processes, whereas the N2 component may indicate the functional overlap between inhibition and error correction. In sum, the present study has developed reliable and objective indices of motor inhibition by introducing force, force-rate and electrophysiological measures, further elucidating our understandings of dynamic motor inhibition and error correction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, traditional binary keyboards used in these experiments are unable to capture the subtleties of sub-threshold response-force dynamics. This has led to the neglect of potential sub-threshold motor-inhibition processes. In two experiments, we explored sub-threshold inhibition by using a custom force-sensitive keyboard to record response force in both {GNG} and {SST}. In experiment 1, participants displayed increased response force when correctly rejecting no-go targets in the {GNG} task compared to the baseline. In addition, they exhibited higher response force in hit trials than in false alarms, revealing engagement of both motor-restraint and motor-cancellation processes in {GNG}. Initially, participants utilised motor restraint, but if it failed to prevent inappropriate responses, they employed motor cancellation to stop responses before reaching the keypress threshold. In experiment 2, we used participants’ average response-force amplitude and response-force latency in {SST} stop trials to characterise the motor-cancellation process. Average amplitude significantly predicted false-alarm rates in the {GNG} task, but the relationship between response latency and false-alarm rates was insignificant. We hypothesised that response latency reflects reactive inhibition control in motor cancellation, whereas average amplitude indicates proactive inhibition control. Our findings underscore the complexity of motor inhibition.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Past research has found that the speed of the action cancellation process is influenced by the sensory modality/modalities of the environmental change that triggers it. However, the effect on selective stopping processes (where participants must cancel only one component of a multi-component movement) remains unknown, despite these complex movements often being required as we navigate our busy modern world.
          Thirty healthy adults (mean age = 31.1 years, {SD} = 10.5) completed five response-selective stop signal tasks featuring different combinations of “go signal” modality (the environmental change baring an imperative to initiate movement; auditory or visual) and “stop signal” modality (the environmental change indicating that action cancellation is required; auditory, visual, or audiovisual). Electromyographical ({EMG}) recordings of effector muscles allowed detailed comparison of the characteristics of voluntary action and cancellation between tasks.
          
            Behavioural and physiological measures of stopping speed demonstrated that the modality of the
            go
            signal influenced how quickly participants cancelled movement in response to the stop signal: stopping was faster in two cross-modal experimental conditions (auditory go - visual stop; visual go - auditory stop), than in two conditions using the same modality for both signals. A separate condition testing for multisensory facilitation revealed that stopping was fastest when the stop signal consisted of a
            combined
            audiovisual stimulus, compared to all other go-stop stimulus combinations. These findings provide novel evidence regarding the role of attentional networks in action cancellation and suggest modality specific cognitive resources influence the latency of the stopping process.},

For example, stopping the hand dampens the excitability of the task-irrelevant leg. However, it is unclear whether this ‘global suppression’ could apply across wider motor modalities. Here we tested whether stopping speech leads to suppression of the task-irrelevant hand. We used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the primary motor cortex with concurrent electromyography from the hand. We found that when speech was successfully stopped the motor evoked potential from the task-irrelevant hand was significantly reduced compared to when the participant failed to stop speaking, or responded on non stop signal trials, or compared to baseline. This shows that when speech is quickly stopped, there is a broad suppression across the motor system. This has implications for the neural basis of speech control and stuttering.},

In this task, estimates of the speed of inhibition based on a simple-stopping model are inappropriate, and have produced inconsistent findings about the effects of proactive control on motor inhibition. We instead used a multi-modal approach, based on improved methods of detecting and interpreting partial electromyographical responses and the recently proposed {SIS} (simultaneously inhibit and start) model of selective stopping behaviour.

However, an emerging body of evidence suggests that the {SST} conflates two dissociable sources of inhibition, namely an involuntarily pause associated with attentional capture and the (subsequent) voluntary cancellation of action. The extent to which these processes also occur in other response tasks is unknown. Younger n = 24 (20–35 years) and older n = 23 (60–85 years) adults completed tasks involving rapid unimanual or bimanual responses to visual stimuli. A subset of trials required cancellation of one component of an initial bimanual response (i.e., selective stop task; stop left response, continue right response) or enacting an additional response (e.g., press left button as well as right button). Critically, both tasks involved some infrequent stimuli baring no behavioral imperative (i.e., they had to be ignored). {EMG} recordings of voluntary responses during stopping tasks revealed bimanual covert responses (muscle activation, which was suppressed before a button press ensued), consistent with a pause process, following both stop and ignore stimuli, before the required response was subsequently enacted. Critically, we also observed the behavioral consequences of a similar involuntary pause in trials where action cancellation was not part of the response set. Notably, the period over which movements were susceptible to response delays from additional stimuli was longer for older adults than younger adults. The findings demonstrate that an involuntary attentional component of inhibition significantly contributes to action cancellation processes.},

Yet the rapid stopping of an initiated response is apparently underpinned by a neurocognitive mechanism that has global effects on multiple tendencies. This limits such studies as models of cognitive control because they do not explain the selectivity of control over particular tendencies that is apparent in everyday life. We hypothesized that subjects employ a selective stopping mechanism when they have foreknowledge of which response to stop, but employ a global stopping mechanism when they do not have such foreknowledge. Comparing foreknowledge and noforeknowledge conditions, we show that when subjects have foreknowledge, stopping is indeed more selective, as evidenced by less of an effect on the concurrent execution of an alternative response; however, stopping is also slower when subjects have foreknowledge. Thus, selective and global mechanisms of stopping can be dissociated. We suggest that the selective mechanism is used when people maintain the goal of controlling particular responses, whereas the global mechanism is used when it is essential to stop quickly.},

Crucially, the verb could describe manual actions, non-manual actions or non-motor processes, with either aﬃrmative (You do sign it) or negative (You don’t sign it) polarity. We assessed the impact of verb type and polarity on two typing dimensions: motor programming (lapse between target onset and ﬁrst keystroke) and motor execution (lapse between ﬁrst and last keystroke). Negation yielded no eﬀect on motor planning, but it selectively delayed typing execution for manualaction verbs, irrespective of the subjects’ typing skills. This suggests that processing negations during comprehension of manual-action sentences recruits inhibitory mechanisms acting on same-eﬀector movements.

Against this backdrop, the present pilot study investigated the use of negation within directional instructions (i.e., “not left”, “now left”, “not right”, “now right”) in children with {ADHD} and a control group. The results indicate that children in general have a long response delay following negative compared to affirmative instructions. Additionally, there was a tendency for this effect to be more pronounced in the {ADHD} group. Together, these results suggest that negation processing might indeed demand inhibitory control processes, which are differently available across different subgroups. Thus, the current study provides evidence that using negation in imperatives or instructions is generally rather critical and should be avoided if possible, but that negation use is probably even more problematic in specific clinical populations. Potential implications of these results will be discussed.},

The 5 experiments reported here tested this theoretical claim, presenting cues that indicated whether or not stop signals were relevant for the next few trials. Subjects made proactive response-strategy adjustments in each experiment: Diffusionmodel fits showed that response threshold increased when participants expected stop signals to occur, slowing go responses and increasing accuracy. Furthermore, the results show that subjects can make proactive response-strategy adjustments on a trial-by-trial basis, suggesting a flexible cognitive system that can proactively adjust itself in changing environments.},

	abstract = {The stop-signal task, in which participants must inhibit prepotent responses, has been used to identify neural systems that vary with individual differences in inhibitory control. To explore how these differences relate to other aspects of decision making, a drift-diffusion model of simple decisions was fitted to stop-signal task data from go trials to extract measures of caution, motor execution time, and stimulus processing speed for each of 123 participants. These values were used to probe {fMRI} data to explore individual differences in neural activation. Faster processing of the go stimulus correlated with greater activation in the right frontal pole for both go and stop trials. On stop trials, stimulus processing speed also correlated with regions implicated in inhibitory control, including the right inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and {BG}. Individual differences in motor execution time correlated with activation of the right parietal cortex. These findings suggest a robust relationship between the speed of stimulus processing and inhibitory processing at the neural level. This model-based approach provides novel insight into the interrelationships among decision components involved in inhibitory control and raises interesting questions about strategic adjustments in performance and inhibitory deficits associated with psychopathology.},

The model can accurately predict driving decision outcomes (whether to proceed through the intersection during the yellow signal phase) and the decision-making times of different drivers. Driving data were collected using a driving simulator, including 15 participants in 210 tests in seven scenarios (3150 experimental samples). Drivers with similar driving behaviors were grouped. The model was validated using both in-sample and out-of-sample data for both individual and representative drivers. It was found that the error rate of the predicted data was approximately 7 \%. Different arrival times had a significant impact on decision response time. Drivers tended to make faster decisions when the arrival time was less than 2 s due to the urgency of the decision.

	doi = {10.1017/S1355617722000431},
	abstract = {Objective:
Reaction time variability ({RTV}) has been estimated using Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and diffusion model ({DM}) indices. Rarely have studies examined interrelationships among these performance indices in childhood, and the use of reaction time ({RT}) computational models has been slow to take hold in the developmental psychopathology literature. Here, we extend prior work in adults by examining the interrelationships among different model parameters in the {ABCD} sample and demonstrate how computational models of {RT} can clarify mechanisms of time-on-task effects and sex differences in {RTs}.


Method:
This study utilized trial-level data from the stop signal task from 8916 children (9–10 years old) to examine Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and {DM} indicators of {RTV}. In addition to describing {RTV} patterns, we examined interrelations among these indicators, temporal patterns, and sex differences.


Results:
There was no one-to-one correspondence between {DM} and ex-Gaussian parameters. Nonetheless, drift rate was most strongly associated with standard deviation of {RT} and tau, while nondecisional processes were most strongly associated with {RT}, mu, and sigma. Performance worsened across time with changes driven primarily by decreasing drift rate. Boys were faster and less variable than girls, likely attributable to girls’ wide boundary separation.


Conclusions:
Intercorrelations among model parameters are similar in children as has been observed in adults. Computational approaches play a crucial role in understanding performance changes over time and can also clarify mechanisms of group differences. For example, standard {RT} models may incorrectly suggest slowed processing speed in girls that is actually attributable to other factors.},

However, Because those studies did not spectify rate of force production, response force probably was mainly controlled by force unit duration rather than by recruitment of force units, which may explain this negative finding. To enforce recruitment control, we factorially combined peak force (10\% or 50\% of maximal voluntary finger force) and time to peak force (100 or 200 ms). A precue provided advance information about the responding index finger (left vs. right). After 1 s, the imperative stimulus followed, requiring a brisk isometric flexion of the specified index finger. Symmetric effects, maximal at the vertex, of both force and rate of force production were observed 200–100 ms before the imperative stimulus in stimulus-synchronized averages and 200–100 ms before response onset in response-synchronized averages. However, neither force nor rate to force production affected the lateralized readiness potential. We conclude that this measure does not reflect movement parameters but appears to indicate an abstract preparation of lateralized response channels.},

	abstract = {In three experiments we measured response time ({RT}) and peak force ({PF}) to investigate the grouping of left- and right-hand key press responses in a dual-task paradigm involving two independent go/no-go tasks. Within each task, a go stimulus within one of two modalities (i.e., visual versus auditory) required a response by one hand. In Experiment 1 with simultaneous go stimuli in the two tasks, responses appeared to be grouped in approximately 75–80\% of trials, compared with nearly 100\% grouping in a single-task condition requiring bimanual responses to the onset of any stimulus in either modality. In Experiment 2 with stimulus onset asynchronies ({SOAs}) of 0–400 ms between the two go stimuli, response grouping clearly declined as {SOA} increased, although some grouping was still evident even at the longest {SOA}. The same pattern was observed in Experiment 3 with the same range of {SOAs} but unpredictable stimulus order, suggesting that grouping is not strongly dependent on prior knowledge of the likely response order. These results emphasize the pervasiveness of response grouping in bimanual dual-task {RT} paradigms and provide useful clues as to its nature.},

A review of chronometric and psychophysiological studies reveals the prevailing view that this temporal preparation operates mainly at a motor level speeding up rather late processes. To assess the locus of this preparation effect, we conducted two experiments employing the lateralized readiness potential ({LRP}). Contrary to this prevailing view, the results of both experiments clearly indicate that temporal preparation enhances the processing speed of relatively early processes, because a manipulation of temporal uncertainty affected {RT}, the P300 latency, and the stimulus-to-{LRP} interval but not the {LRP}-to-keypress interval.},

Fast-dm is easy to use: it reads input data from simple text files, while program settings are specified by command0s in a control file. With fast-dm, complex models can be fitted, where some parameters may vary between experimental conditions, while other parameters are constrained to be equal across conditions.

The current study presents a set of evidence-based guidelines for using the stop-signal paradigm. The evidence was derived from a series of simulations aimed at (a) examining the effects of experimental design features on inhibition indices, and (b) testing the assumptions of the horse-race model that underlies the stop-signal paradigm.

	abstract = {An emerging class of theories concerning the functional structure of the brain takes the reuse of neural circuitry for various cognitive purposes to be a central organizational principle. According to these theories, it is quite common for neural circuits established for one purpose to be exapted (exploited, recycled, redeployed) during evolution or normal development, and be put to different uses, often without losing their original functions. Neural reuse theories thus differ from the usual understanding of the role of neural plasticity (which is, after all, a kind of reuse) in brain organization along the following lines: According to neural reuse, circuits can continue to acquire new uses after an initial or original function is established; the acquisition of new uses need not involve unusual circumstances such as injury or loss of established function; and the acquisition of a new use need not involve (much) local change to circuit structure (e.g., it might involve only the establishment of functional connections to new neural partners). Thus, neural reuse theories offer a distinct perspective on several topics of general interest, such as: the evolution and development of the brain, including (for instance) the evolutionary-developmental pathway supporting primate tool use and human language; the degree of modularity in brain organization; the degree of localization of cognitive function; and the cortical parcellation problem and the prospects (and proper methods to employ) for function to structure mapping. The idea also has some practical implications in the areas of rehabilitative medicine and machine interface design.},

	abstract = {According to the literature, negations such as “not” or “don't” reduce the accessibility in memory of the concepts under their scope. Moreover, negations applied to action contents (e.g., “don't write the letter”) impede the activation of motor processes in the brain, inducing “disembodied” representations. These facts provide important information on the behavioral and neural consequences of negations. However, how negations themselves are processed in the brain is still poorly understood. In two electrophysiological experiments, we explored whether sentential negation shares neural mechanisms with action monitoring or inhibition. Human participants read action-related sentences in affirmative or negative form (“now you will cut the bread” vs “now you will not cut the bread”) while performing a simultaneous Go/{NoGo} task. The analysis of the {EEG} rhythms revealed that theta oscillations were significantly reduced for {NoGo} trials in the context of negative sentences compared with affirmative sentences. Given the fact that theta oscillations are often considered as neural markers of response inhibition processes, their modulation by negative sentences strongly suggests that negation uses neural resources of response inhibition. We propose a new approach that views the syntactic operator of negation as relying on the neural machinery of high-order action-monitoring processes.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Previous studies have shown that linguistic negation reduces the accessibility of the negated concepts and suppresses the activation of specific brain regions that operate in affirmative statements. Although these studies focus on the consequences of negation on cognitive and neural processes, the proper neural mechanisms of negation have not yet been explored. In the present {EEG} study, we tested the hypothesis that negation uses the neural network of action inhibition. Using a Go/{NoGo} task embedded in a sentence comprehension task, we found that negation in the context of {NoGo} trials modulates frontal theta rhythm, which is usually considered a signature of action inhibition and control mechanisms.},

Crucially, the verb could describe manual actions, non-manual actions or non-motor processes, with either aﬃrmative (You do sign it) or negative (You don’t sign it) polarity. We assessed the impact of verb type and polarity on two typing dimensions: motor programming (lapse between target onset and ﬁrst keystroke) and motor execution (lapse between ﬁrst and last keystroke). Negation yielded no eﬀect on motor planning, but it selectively delayed typing execution for manualaction verbs, irrespective of the subjects’ typing skills. This suggests that processing negations during comprehension of manual-action sentences recruits inhibitory mechanisms acting on same-eﬀector movements.

In each trial, participants read one of the following four phrases “now up”, “not up”, “now down” or “not down” and responded with a button press on a response key mounted in the upper versus lower vertical space. Behavioral data indicated that processing negated phrases leads to considerable processing difficulties for participants even after extensive practice. Interestingly, in line with standard conflict adaptation effects reported in the Simon, the Flanker and the Stroop task, negation processing was facilitated when preceded by another high conflict trial (i.e. a negated trial) as compared to a low conflict trial (i.e. an affirmative phrase). In addition, electrophysiological data showed that in negated trials first the to-be-negated information was activated (i.e., up in the case of “not up”) and only in a second step, the outcome of the negation process was represented (i.e. down). In line with behavioral data, electrophysiological data was modified by trial sequence, suggesting negation triggering standard conflict adaptation patterns. Taken together, conflict-related processing adjustments can be also observed if the conflict is triggered by linguistic negation of vertical directional words. Implications of these findings are discussed.},
