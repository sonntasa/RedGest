	abstract = {We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, {EEGLAB}, running under the cross-platform {MATLAB} environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged {EEG} data of any number of channels. Available functions include {EEG} data, channel and event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial {ERP}-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}) and time/frequency decompositions including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap statistical methods based on data resampling. {EEGLAB} functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use {MATLAB} syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of {EEGLAB} to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive ‘pop’ functions. Experienced {MATLAB} users can use {EEGLAB} data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A ‘plug-in’ facility allows easy incorporation of new {EEG} modules into the main menu. {EEGLAB} is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the {GNU} public license for noncommercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.},

	abstract = {This paper describes {FieldTrip}, an open source software package that we developed for the analysis of {MEG}, {EEG}, and other electrophysiological data. The software is implemented as a {MATLAB} toolbox and includes a complete set of consistent and user-friendly high-level functions that allow experimental neuroscientists to analyze experimental data. It includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis, such as time-frequency analysis using multitapers, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers, connectivity analysis, and nonparametric statistical permutation tests at the channel and source level. The implementation as toolbox allows the user to perform elaborate and structured analyses of large data sets using the {MATLAB} command line and batch scripting. Furthermore, users and developers can easily extend the functionality and implement new algorithms. The modular design facilitates the reuse in other software packages.},

	abstract = {Averaged event-related potential ({ERP}) data recorded from the human scalp reveal electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity that is reliably time-locked and phase-locked to experimental events. We report here the application of a method based on information theory that decomposes one or more {ERPs} recorded at multiple scalp sensors into a sum of components with fixed scalp distributions and sparsely activated, maximally independent time courses. Independent component analysis ({ICA}) decomposes {ERP} data into a number of components equal to the number of sensors. The derived components have distinct but not necessarily orthogonal scalp projections. Unlike dipole-fitting methods, the algorithm does not model the locations of their generators in the head. Unlike methods that remove second-order correlations, such as principal component analysis ({PCA}), {ICA} also minimizes higher-order dependencies. Applied to detected—and undetected—target {ERPs} from an auditory vigilance experiment, the algorithm derived ten components that decomposed each of the major response peaks into one or more {ICA} components with relatively simple scalp distributions. Three of these components were active only when the subject detected the targets, three other components only when the target went undetected, and one in both cases. Three additional components accounted for the steady-state brain response to a 39-Hz background click train. Major features of the decomposition proved robust across sessions and changes in sensor number and placement. This method of {ERP} analysis can be used to compare responses from multiple stimuli, task conditions, and subject states.},

	abstract = {We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},
