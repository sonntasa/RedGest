# Notes on the actual experiment

- It is honestly excruciatingly slow paced. Do we need a whole 2.5 second
  sentence presentation before the stimulus appears?
- Is there a too fast vs./ to slow cut-off?
- Do we correctly have the information onset as RT-baseline value?

## Theoretical Notes

- Lisa argues that the activation of cognitive control facilitates the
  inhibition of automatic activation. I think this is a sound hypothesis.
  However, we argue against that in another study. How do we explain the
  interaction?
- Maybe I'm wrong here, but an explanation using the cognitive load theory
  would also suggest that we would not find a facilitating effect of the
  matching gesture in the affirmative condition? Or do we assume that negation
  simply always has higher processing demands that the redundancy in
  affirmation doesn't require?
